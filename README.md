# SAML10_RegisterMap
Register map for the SAML10 microcontroller along with methods to control them.
There's multiple things I messed up here, but for a first attempt at writing a partial register map with minimal guidance. I think it's fine.  Also I didn't use volatile like I was supposed to, so there may be problems...
